# Example Java for Linked List

Feel free to create a branch and play around a bit with the code. 
Here are some ideas:

- Create a few nodes and add them to both ends of a new linked list
- Print your linked list out using your .printList() method
- Remove your linked list’s head node
- Print your list again — was your original head node removed?
- So far we’ve built a method to remove the head of the list. How do you think you would remove a node that has a specific data?
